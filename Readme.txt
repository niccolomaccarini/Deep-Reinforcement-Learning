To test the performance of the different values of epsilon greedy exploration, it's necessary to open the test.ipynb notebook and 
run the 'experiment' function. All parameters can be set before running. To compare DQN with DQN-ER run the experiment_replay function 
in the same file, with Helper.py, cartpole_encironment.py and Assignment2_batch_updates.py in the same location.
